# JG Utility Files

This is a repository of some snippets of C++ code I've written, mostly for working with OpenGL.
This project does not serve as a library with its own unique functionality, but just as a collection of these files.
I have initially written these for a persona project, but have since then reused them in a few other places.
At the time of me writing this, all these projects are unpublished.
However, those are likely to end up with vastly different and potentially contradictory licenses.
I am preemptively resolving any potential licensing issues, by publishing these shared code snippets as Creative Commons.
